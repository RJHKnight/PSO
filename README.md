# PSO

Quite possibly a POS PSO...

## Introduction

A basic implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimiser written in R. 

This was written purely for my personal education, there are no doubt more sophisticated and complete implementations available. Use at your own risk...

## Installation

You can install the development version from github using devtools:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rjhknight/PSO")
```
